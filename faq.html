    <h6><i>What's this all about then?</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>The <b>Really Strange Record Club</b> is a place to meet with like-minded people whose taste in music is as adventurous as yours. We'll listen to records, hang out and have a good time. Come and join us!</p>

    <h6><i>What will we listen to?</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>Anyone can bring along a record for us to listen to. Just <a href="mailto:hello@reallystrangerecord.club">email us</a> in advance to let us know what you're bringing. If there's more records than we have time for, we'll put the titles in a hat and pick them via a random draw.</p>

    <h6><i>Do I have to bring vinyl?</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>We assume most people probably will bring vinyl, but feel free to bring along CDs, tapes, files you've bought off Bandcamp on a memory stick, etc. Just <a href="mailto:hello@reallystrangerecord.club">let us know in advance</a> so we can make sure we've got something to play it on. The only proviso is that we've love you to bring something you <i>own</i>, rather than a Spotify link or something.</p>

    <h6><i>I have a record I'd like to bring, but I'm not sure if it's "strange" enough.</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>It definitely is! We really only mean something that's a bit off the beaten track i.e. you're not likely to hear it on mainstream radio. We're not just talking about ultra avant-garde pointy-headed free jazz stuff (although if you want to bring some ultra avant-garde pointy-headed free jazz stuff: brilliant, please do!).</p>

    <h6><i>So there's no genre rules?</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>None. You are just as welcome to bring a Finnish IDM 12" or Sun Ra LP as you are a Japanese ambient mix, a Sonic Youth live bootleg tape, some lo-fi indiepop you found on Bandcamp or a classic shoegaze single. Surprise us! The point of this is to share what you love and to hear something new.</p>

    <h6><i>How do I find out more?</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>All the action is on the <a href="https://reallystrangerecordclub.substack.com">mailing list</a> - that's where you'll hear first about upcoming events, get a sneak preview of records people are bringing along and more.</p>

    <h6><i>I think I've got a question you've not covered here.</i></h6>
    <h3>
		<p>Entirely likely. <a href="mailto:hello@reallystrangerecord.club">Email us</a> and we'll update this as we go!</p>
